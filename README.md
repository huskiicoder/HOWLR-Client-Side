  <p align="center">
    This is the front of the HOWLR chat app project. Built by a team of 5 student-developers from the <a href="uw.edu">University of Washington</a>, this full-feature 5-tier chat app project
    is inspired by the Univeristy of Washington's mascott, the Husky. This front end is built nearly entirely in <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a>, and
    was designed using <a href="https://material.io/design">Google Material Design</a> concepts and elements. The <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html">Adobe Creative Suite</a> 
    was used to model, prototype, and design the app and it's corresponding elements.
    View the <a href="https://github.com/huskiicoder/HOWLR-Server-Side/blob/master/README.md">server side</a> of the project if you're interested in the backend.
